# Grover-biprime-factorisation
Factoring large integers into their prime components is a fundamental problem with significant implications in cryptography and information security. Traditional algorithms, like Shor's algorithm, have demonstrated superpolynomial speedups over classical methods but require quantum computers with millions of qubits. Grover's search algorithm, traditionally used for database search, provides a quadratic speedup and is now being explored for factoring bi-primes. The oracle can be built using adder and multiplier circuits utilising the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
